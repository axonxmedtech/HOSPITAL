# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

### Backend (Spring Boot / Maven)
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run          # Start dev server (port 8080)
mvn clean package -DskipTests # Build JAR
mvn test                     # Run tests
```

### Frontend (React / Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm install                  # Install dependencies
npm run dev                  # Start dev server (port 5173)
npm run build                # Production build (runs tsc then vite build)
```

### Database
```bash
# Initial setup
CREATE DATABASE hospital_management;
# Then run: setup/setup-super-admin.sql
# Optional test data: setup/test-data-doctors.sql
```

## Architecture

This is a **multi-tenant SaaS Hospital Management System** — a monorepo with a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend.

### Tenant Model
Two tiers:
- **Platform level** — Super Admin manages hospitals (onboarding, billing)
- **Hospital level** — Hospital Admin manages their own staff and patients

All hospital-scoped entities carry a `hospital_id` foreign key. The backend extracts `hospitalId` from the JWT claims via `SecurityHelper.getCurrentHospitalId()` and enforces tenant isolation in every service method.

### Backend (`backend/src/main/java/com/hms/`)

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `entity/` | JPA entities (Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Opd, Ipd, Prescription, Medicine, Billing, …) |
| `repository/` | Spring Data JPA repositories |
| `service/hospital/` | Business logic for hospital-level operations |
| `service/platform/` | Platform (Super Admin) operations |
| `controller/hospital/` | REST handlers under `/hospital/**` |
| `controller/platform/` | REST handlers under `/platform/**` |
| `controller/publicapi/` | Unauthenticated endpoints (`/api/public/**`) |
| `security/` | JWT filter (`JwtAuthenticationFilter`), `JwtUtil`, `SecurityHelper` |
| `config/` | Spring Security config, Redis config, WebSocket config, CORS |
| `dto/` | Request/response DTOs |

**API URL namespaces:**
- `/platform/**` — Super Admin only
- `/hospital/**` — All hospital roles (ADMIN, DOCTOR, RECEPTIONIST, PHARMACIST, NURSE, NURSE_INCHARGE, OT_INCHARGE)
- `/clinic/**`, `/pharmacy/**` — clinic and pharmacy tenants (ADMIN, DOCTOR, RECEPTIONIST, PHARMACIST). Shared endpoints are aliased across tenants by listing every path on one handler, e.g. `@GetMapping({"/hospital/settings/fees", "/clinic/settings/fees", "/pharmacy/settings/fees"})`.
- `/api/public/health` — unauthenticated health check
- `/ws/**` — WebSocket

**Roles:** `SUPER_ADMIN`, `HOSPITAL_ADMIN`, `DOCTOR`, `RECEPTIONIST`, `PHARMACIST`, `NURSE` (staff nurse), `NURSE_INCHARGE`, `OT_INCHARGE`. Roles are plain strings on `User.role`; `JwtAuthenticationFilter` maps them to `ROLE_<role>` authorities (so a new role works in `@PreAuthorize` once added to the relevant `hasAnyRole(...)` lists in `SecurityConfig` for `/hospital/**` and `/ws/**`). There is no central role enum/whitelist.

Special flag: `isSingleDoctor` on a `HOSPITAL_ADMIN` user lets that admin also act as the sole doctor (single-doctor clinic mode).

### Plan modules & migrations (used constantly)
- **Module gating:** a hospital's plan enables modules (`OPD`, `IPD`, `PHARMACY`, `BILLING`, `NURSING`, `OT`, …). Backend gates controllers/methods with `@RequireModule("NURSING")` (enforced by `ModuleAccessAspect`); the frontend reads `user.modules` and conditionally renders tabs. The module list lives in `frontend/src/components/PlansTab.jsx`.
- **Migrations:** `config/DatabaseMigrationRunner` runs idempotent `ensureXxx()` methods on `ApplicationReadyEvent` (each checks `information_schema` then `CREATE TABLE` / `ALTER TABLE`, wrapped in try/catch). Add a new `ensureXxxTable()`/`addColumnIfMissing(...)`, call it from `runMigrations()`, **and** mirror the DDL in `setup/schema-full.sql`. Hibernate `ddl-auto=update` also applies entity changes, so migrations are a safety net + the canonical schema record.
- **Errors:** `GlobalExceptionHandler` maps `IllegalArgumentException`→400, `UnauthorizedException`→401, `AccessDeniedException`→403. `ApiResponse.error(msg)` puts the message in the **`error`** field — the frontend reads `err.response.data.error`.
- **Audit:** `AuditLogService.logAction(action, details, performedByEmail, hospitalId, entityType, entityId, reason)` — best-effort, wrap calls in try/catch.

### OT (Operation Theatre) module — `OT`-gated
`Surgery` (own lifecycle REQUESTED→SCHEDULED→IN_PROGRESS→COMPLETED, linked to an IPD admission) + a generic `surgery_forms` JSON store backing 15 NABH forms. Doctor requests a surgery from the IPD case; reception schedules (any doctor or free-text operator + optional anaesthetist + a single-bed OT ward) and runs Start/Complete. OT wards are identified by name containing "OT". Frontend: `pages/hospital/ot/` (`SurgeryFormFrame` is the shared fill→save→print shell; `surgeryFormsRegistry.jsx` lists the forms). Nurse fills the forms from the surgery-patient "Consent Forms" tab.

### Nursing Management module — `NURSING`-gated (built in phases A–D)
- **Hierarchy:** `HOSPITAL_ADMIN` → `NURSE_INCHARGE` (manages assigned wards) → `NURSE` (staff). An incharge is a `NurseProfile` with `is_incharge=true` + a `User` of role `NURSE_INCHARGE`; staff nurses may have no login. `Ward.incharge_nurse_id` links a ward to its incharge (one incharge, many wards). Ward-scope RBAC lives in `security/NurseInchargeGuard` (admin bypasses; incharge limited to their `myWardIds()`); staff-nurse "only your patients" is `security/NurseAccessGuard`; `security/NurseWriteAccess` picks the right guard per role for nursing writes.
- **Separate Nurse Login setting** (`hospital_settings.separate_nurse_login`, default OFF): OFF → staff nurses have no login and the incharge records care, choosing a "Performed By Nurse" (`security/PerformingNurseResolver` + `performed_by_nurse_id` on nursing records); ON → the logged-in nurse is recorded.
- **Patient assignment** (`PatientAssignmentService`, replaces least-loaded auto-assign): reception admits to a ward (which must have an incharge and an Available bed); OFF → incharge handles; ON + exactly one ward staff nurse → auto-assign; ON + many → incharge assigns.
- **Time Slots / scheduling:** `shift_templates` + `appointment_slots` (admin CRUD, `TimeSlotController`); `nurse_shift_schedules` snapshot the template's times so editing a template only rewrites **future** schedules. "On shift now" is derived from today's schedule (no manual toggle).
- **Beds:** four states `available/occupied/cleaning/maintenance` (`entity/BedStatus`); **all** bed status writes go through `BedStatusService` (audited into `bed_status_audits`). Vacating a bed (discharge / transfer / OT complete) marks it `cleaning`; the incharge marks it cleaned → available.
- **Attendance:** `nurse_attendance` (one row per nurse/date, upserted, shift window snapshotted).
- Frontend: `pages/hospital/NurseDashboard.jsx` (staff), `NurseInchargeDashboard.jsx` + `pages/hospital/nurse-incharge/*` (incharge), `pages/hospital/nurse/*` (shared nurse views). Remaining phases (E incharge dashboard, F substitution, G calendar) are speced in `docs/superpowers/`.

### Files & Access (per-hospital form availability + edit permission)
Hospital-scoped config controlling which clinical forms are active and who may edit each (`DOCTOR` / `NURSE` / `BOTH`). **Not module-gated** — shared by hospital and clinic tenants (excluded only for pharmacy).
- **Canonical list:** `service/hospital/FormRegistry` (20 forms: 4 nursing records — `VITALS`, `NOTES` (the Re-Assessment Sheet), `INITIAL_ASSESSMENT`, `VULNERABILITY_ASSESSMENT`, `SUGAR_CHART` — + 15 OT/NABH forms whose keys match `frontend/.../ot/surgeryFormsRegistry.jsx` `type` values). `NURSE_INCHARGE` normalizes to `NURSE`; `HOSPITAL_ADMIN` sees everything editable.
- **Storage & defaults:** `hospital_form_access` stores only *overrides*; a form with **no row is enabled + BOTH** (lazy default, no seeding). `FormAccessService`: `list()`, `update()`, `effectiveForRole(role)` → `HIDDEN` / `READ_ONLY` / `EDITABLE`, and **`assertCanEdit(formKey)`** (throws `AccessDeniedException`) called in the write paths of the vitals/assessment/vulnerability/sugar/notes services — **server-side enforcement, not just UI**. API: `/hospital/form-access` (admin) + `/effective` (any staff role reads their verdict map).
- **Enforcement rule:** Off ⇒ tab hidden for everyone; On ⇒ the access role(s) edit, the other role is read-only (the entry form is *hidden*, records stay visible/printable). Applied in `NursePatientDetail` (nurse) and `IpdDetails` (doctor's IPD case, which mirrors the nurse sub-tabs). Medication and the OPD Medication tab reuse `MedicationPanel` with a `readOnly` prop; nurse form panels take `readOnly` and hide their nurse-only "Performed By Nurse" UI for non-nurses. UI card: `pages/hospital/FilesAndAccessCard.jsx` in Settings.

### OPD vitals settings (per-hospital + custom vitals)
Each hospital picks which vitals are captured at OPD entry and can define its own. **Not module-gated** (hospital + clinic).
- **Built-ins:** `service/hospital/VitalRegistry` (`BP`, `TEMPERATURE`, `PULSE`, `HEIGHT`, `WEIGHT`, `SPO2`), each mapped to a typed `opd` column. **Custom** vitals live in `hospital_vitals` (`is_custom=true`) and their values in the **`opd.custom_vitals` JSON** column (built-ins keep their typed columns).
- **Defaults/rules:** lazy — a built-in with no `hospital_vitals` row is enabled; toggling writes an override. Built-ins can be turned off but **never deleted**; only customs are deletable (deleting keeps historical values). Custom vitals have **no validation**; built-ins keep theirs (BP `120/80` format, numerics ranged). `VitalSettingsService`: `list`/`enabledVitals`/`toggle`/`addCustom`/`deleteCustom` + `enabledBuiltInKeys`/`enabledCustomKeys` (used by `OpdService` to drop disabled vitals server-side) + `enabledVitalsFor(hospitalId)` (used by `ClinicalPdfService` to build the case-paper VITAL SIGNS table dynamically). API `/hospital/vitals`. Frontend: `VitalsSettingsCard.jsx` (Settings) + `hooks/useEnabledVitals.js` (drives the 3 OPD entry forms and the doctor's `ConsultationModal` vitals strip).

### Design docs
Specs and phase plans live under `docs/superpowers/specs/` and `docs/superpowers/plans/` (dated markdown). Consult the latest `nursing-mgmt-phase*` docs before extending the nurse module.

### Frontend (`frontend/src/`)

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pages/hospital/` | Per-role dashboards: `HospitalAdminDashboard`, `DoctorDashboard`, `ReceptionistDashboard`, `PharmacistDashboard` |
| `pages/platform/` | Super Admin UI |
| `components/` | Shared UI: `DataTable`, `ActionMenu`, `StatusBadge`, `ConfirmationModal`, `Sidebar`, `Navbar`, `PageHeader`, … |
| `services/` | Axios wrappers — `apiService.js` (interceptors), `hospitalService.js`, `authService.js` |
| `context/` | `ToastContext` (global toast notifications) |
| `hooks/` | `useWebSocket`, `useModule` |

**Routing:** React Router 7. `ProtectedRoute` guards all non-login pages. After login the user is redirected to their role's dashboard.

**Auth flow:** JWT stored in `sessionStorage` (tab-isolated). Axios request interceptor injects `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The 401 response interceptor clears the token and redirects to `/login`.

**Table components pattern:** Large dashboard files contain co-located table components at the bottom (`PatientsTable`, `DoctorsTable`, `AppointmentsTable`, etc.) using `@tanstack/react-table` with a `createColumnHelper`. Actions use the shared `ActionMenu` component (three-dot dropdown). The `isAdmin` prop controls whether the Actions column is rendered.

### Database schema source of truth
`setup/schema-full.sql` is the canonical schema. Entity classes in `entity/` mirror it. When adding columns, update both the SQL (provide the ALTER query) and the JPA entity.

### PDF generation
`PdfService` is a thin facade that delegates to `service/pdf/`: `ClinicalPdfService` (prescription / case paper), `BillingPdfService` (receipts), and `ReportPdfService` (OPD reports), with shared drawing in `PdfLayoutHelper`. PDFs are built programmatically with **OpenPDF** (`PdfPTable`, `document.add(...)`) — there are no HTML/Thymeleaf templates. The case paper's VITAL SIGNS table is built from the hospital's enabled vitals (see OPD vitals settings).

### WebSocket
Real-time dashboard updates. Config in `com.hms.config.WebSocketConfig`. Secured with JWT. Frontend hook: `useWebSocket`.

## Environment

**Backend** reads from `.env` (loaded via Spring's property source):
- `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_USERNAME`, `SPRING_DATASOURCE_PASSWORD`
- `JWT_SECRET`
- `FRONTEND_URL` (CORS origin)
- `SPRING_REDIS_HOST`, `SPRING_REDIS_PORT`

**Frontend** reads from `.env`:
- `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8080`)
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` (logo uploads)
