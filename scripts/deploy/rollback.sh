# Operator-triggered rollback — runs ON the VPS. Restores the previous artifact set that the
# last deployment saved to ../rollback_backup, restarts the service, and re-verifies health.
# Writes a plain-text rollback report to stdout (captured by the workflow for the audit trail).
#
# Usage: rollback.sh <repo_path> <service_name> <liveness_url>
# Requires: a prior deployment created ../rollback_backup (prev_backend.jar, prev_frontend_dist,
#           prev_sha.txt). Documented limitation: does NOT roll back the database.
