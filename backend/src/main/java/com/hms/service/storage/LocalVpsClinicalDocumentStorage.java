/**
 * Clinical documents on a private directory of the server's own filesystem.
 *
 * <p>The directory is deliberately not anywhere a web server publishes. There is no URL for a
 * patient's blood report -- the only way to read one is through the authenticated endpoint above
 * this class, which resolves the document tenant-scoped first. That makes the privacy property
 * structural rather than a setting somebody could switch off.
 *
 * <p>Keys are generated here from random UUIDs. Nothing in a stored path comes from a patient's
 * name, the original filename, or anything else a person could guess or that would leak who a
 * document belongs to if the directory listing were ever seen.
 *
 * <h2>Why nothing here works with whole paths</h2>
 *
 * <p>Checking a path and then using it is two operations, and an attacker who can create entries
 * inside the root gets to act in between: validate {@code <root>/h42} while it does not exist,
 * plant {@code h42 -> /elsewhere}, and the create that follows walks straight through the link.
 * No amount of re-checking closes that -- the check and the syscall resolve the name separately.
 *
 * <h2>What the root is assumed to be</h2>
 *
 * <p>The configured directory is private to the service account: {@code 0700}, owned by the user
 * the application runs as, and nothing else on the host writes inside it. That is enforced here
 * as far as a process can enforce it -- the root is refused if it is a symlink, and every
 * directory this class creates is owner-only from the moment it exists -- and it is the boundary
 * the guarantees below are stated against. A hospital user reaching the API cannot create a file,
 * a directory or a symlink inside the root; only this class does. An attacker who already has the
 * service account's own filesystem authority is a different situation entirely: they can read the
 * documents directly, and no arrangement of Java filesystem calls changes that.
 *
 * <p>What is guaranteed against concurrent legitimate requests, which is the case that actually
 * happens: no document overwrites another, no request deletes another's file, nothing escapes
 * the root, and no half-written file is ever reachable as a document.
 *
 * <h2>What a failed write leaves behind</h2>
 *
 * <p>A write that fails part-way leaves its file on disk, deliberately. Removing it would mean
 * unlinking by name, and a name is not a handle: Linux reuses an inode the instant it is freed,
 * so the identity check that would make such a delete safe cannot actually tell this file from
 * one that replaced it. Java offers no unlink through the descriptor already held. Between
 * leaving a few bytes nobody can reach and holding a delete that could, on a bad day, remove a
 * different patient's report, the orphan is the safer half of the trade.
 *
 * <p>Nothing points at it. The key is a fresh UUID that this call never returns, and the caller
 * records a document only when store() succeeds, so no row and no API path names it. A
 * maintenance sweep for such files belongs in operations, not in an upload request.
 *
 * <p>So every directory step is taken through a {@link SecureDirectoryStream}, which resolves
 * names against an already-open descriptor for the directory above, with links refused at each
 * step. Once a descriptor is held it keeps referring to the directory it was opened on, whatever
 * gets renamed or replaced afterwards. Directory creation -- the one thing that API has no
 * relative form of -- is done by creating the directory directly in the root (whose own path is
 * operator-owned, not attacker-writable) and moving it into place with the descriptor-relative
 * move, which is a {@code renameat} and cannot traverse a link either.
