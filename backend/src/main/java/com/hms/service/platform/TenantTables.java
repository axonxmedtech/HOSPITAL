/**
 * Every table that holds tenant data, what kind of tenant data it is, and whether deleting a
 * facility may remove it.
 *
 * <p>The point of writing this down is the fence around it: {@code TenantTablesFenceTest} fails
 * if a table carrying a {@code hospital_id} column is not listed here. Thirty-nine tenant tables
 * accumulated outside the delete path precisely because nothing forced anyone to notice them; a
 * developer adding a tenant table now has to say what it is, and that is a deliberate edit rather
 * than an omission.
 *
 * <p><b>Declared, not derived.</b> Deletion never enumerates {@code information_schema} at
 * runtime: a delete that changes shape with the database it happens to be pointed at is not a
 * delete anyone can reason about, and it would happily purge audit history the moment someone
 * added a column. The schema is consulted only by the fence test, where a mismatch is a build
 * failure rather than data loss.
 *
 * <p><b>{@link Retention#RETAIN_DECISION_REQUIRED} does not mean "currently retained."</b> It
 * means SA-7a takes no position: whatever {@code deleteHospital} does with that table today, it
 * still does. Clinical, financial, HR and audit history are open product decisions, and this
 * registry records that they are open rather than quietly resolving them.
