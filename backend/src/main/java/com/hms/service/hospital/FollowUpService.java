/**

 * a side effect of opening the OPD queue, which created an OPD, a queue entry and an audit row —
 * so a date arriving was indistinguishable from a patient walking in, and reading a screen twice
 * could produce two encounters for one person. Being due is now a question about stored data, and
 * asking it changes nothing.
 *
 * <p>OVERDUE, DUE_TODAY and UPCOMING are derived here from the date rather than stored, so no job
 * has to rewrite anything at midnight and an outage cannot leave a patient in the wrong bucket.
