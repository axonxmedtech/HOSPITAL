/**
 * What "today" means to this deployment.
 *
 * <p>Follow-ups are compared against a calendar date, so the answer decides whether a patient is
 * due, overdue, or not yet expected — and a bare {@code LocalDate.now()} answers it with whatever
 * zone the server happens to be running in. That was already inconsistent: the daily billing
 * scheduler pins {@code Asia/Kolkata} in its cron while every other date call took the JVM
 * default, so the two could disagree about which day it was for several hours.
 *
 * <p>There is no per-facility timezone anywhere in this system — {@code Hospital} and
 * {@code HospitalSetting} have no such column — so this is a single deployment-wide setting
 * rather than a facility one. It is stated here, in one place, instead of being implied in
 * several. If facilities in different zones are ever onboarded this is the seam that has to
 * change, and it is deliberately small.
 *
 * <p>The clock is injectable so tests can hold a date still and prove yesterday, today and
 * tomorrow without sleeping or depending on when they run.
