/**
 * Claims an OPD registration key, so one logical submission produces one registration.
 *
 * <p>Registering a patient is not repeatable: it inserts the OPD, a queue entry and — under
 * "bill before OPD" — a PAID bill. A double-clicked button or a retried request therefore charged
 * the patient twice and queued them twice, with nothing able to detect it afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Deliberately NOT transactional itself. Every step runs in its own transaction via
 * {@link OpdIdempotencyStore}, so a failed insert cannot poison the session that has to read the
 * winner's row, and the caller's clinical transaction is never entangled with request bookkeeping.
