/**
 * OtPermissions - the OT authorization vocabulary, and the role mapping a hospital
 * starts with.
 *
 * Authorization must not depend on a staff designation: the workflow asks "may this
 * caller schedule?", never "is this caller a receptionist?". Permissions are the
 * abstraction; a role is merely the default carrier of a set of them.
 *
 * Kept as a Java registry rather than a table, matching FormRegistry and VitalRegistry:
 * the codes are compile-time constants that endpoints reference by name. Only the
 * hospital's *overrides* are stored (role_permissions).
 *
 * The DEFAULTS below reproduce the pre-Phase-2 @PreAuthorize(hasRole(...)) checks
 * exactly. Do not "improve" them here -- a hospital changes its own mapping through
 * the permission matrix. Any edit to this map silently changes access for every
 * hospital that has not customised it.

     * Day-2 mapping (v2). Day-1 reproduced the pre-Phase-2 hasRole(...) checks exactly, but left
     * three codes -- OT_ASSIGN_TEAM, OT_RECOVERY, OT_TRANSFER -- granted to nobody, and gave
     * HOSPITAL_ADMIN clinical powers (start/complete/schedule/...) it never exercised through the
     * UI. Corrected here:
     *  DOCTOR         requests surgeries, reads its own board, gives anaesthesia clearance,
     *                 and -- as the surgeon of record -- proposes the surgical team.
     *  RECEPTIONIST   the front-desk scheduling role: approves, schedules, starts, completes,
     *                 closes, and transfers a recovered patient onward.
     *  NURSE          fills the OT/NABH forms, runs the WHO checklist bedside, and records
     *                 post-anaesthesia recovery observations.
     *  NURSE_INCHARGE owns ward-side recovery and the onward transfer out of PACU; unlike NURSE
     *                 it also assigns team and covers OT_INCHARGE's duties when unstaffed.
     *  OT_INCHARGE    the theatre-owning role: the full clinical set except HOSPITAL_ADMIN's
     *                 configuration authority. Previously granted nothing at all.
     *  HOSPITAL_ADMIN configuration and read access only -- OT_SETTINGS plus OT_VIEW/OT_FORM_VIEW.
     *                 Routine clinical execution (schedule/start/complete/recovery/...) is
     *                 deliberately withheld: an admin who needs to act clinically customises the
     *                 matrix like any other hospital, rather than the default silently allowing it.
     *
     * OT_ASSIGN_TEAM, OT_RECOVERY and OT_TRANSFER are not new codes -- OtPermissions.ALL and the
     * admin matrix catalogue always listed them -- so a hospital that already granted one of them
     * to a role has an explicit row and is untouched by this change or by the reconciliation
     * migration in DatabaseMigrationRunner. Only a hospital that never granted a code at all
     * (zero role_permissions rows for that permission_code, across every role) receives the
     * backfilled default below.
